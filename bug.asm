mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as the sum of EBX, ECX*4, and 0x10.  The problem is that ECX could potentially be a very large number. If the resulting address is outside the allowed memory range, a segmentation fault (or similar error) will occur.

The issue stems from a lack of bounds checking on ECX.  The code assumes that ECX will always represent a valid index into an array, but this is not guaranteed.

For example, if the program intended to access an array of 10 integers, and ECX was set to 1000, the access would be well beyond the array bounds.
